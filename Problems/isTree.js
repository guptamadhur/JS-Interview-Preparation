/**
 * You are given a directed graph / tree in the form of nodes and edges.
 *
 * root: a number representing the id of the root node
 *
 * nodes: array of ids. Each id is a number and is unique.
 * Eg: nodes = [1, 5, 6]
 *
 * edges: an array of shape {
 *  start: number;
 *  end: number
 * }
 *  and it respresents and edge from the start to end node.
 *
 * Eg: edges = [{ start: 5, end: 6}, { start:6, end: 1}]
 *
 *
 * You need to check if the graph can be called a tree.
 *
 * A tree does not have cycles, and hence you need to check if
 * graph contains any cycles.
 *
 * return  true or false depending on whether it contains cycles
